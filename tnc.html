  <h1 class="h2-heading">Terms and Conditions</h1>

<div class="cont">
    
<h2 class="h2-heading">1. GENERAL TERMS</h2>
<p>All drawings may or will include a subtle sign that you may not remove.</p>
<p>I might record the drawing process and post it on my youtube.</p>
<p>Prices are subject to change based on demand.</p>
<p>I have the right to reject any order that I do not feel comfortable drawing for any reason.</p>

<h2 class="h2-heading">2. PAYMENT</h2>
<p>Currency accepted is either USD or INDIAN Rupees and can be paid through Paytm or any payment service such as MobilePay or bank transfer.</p>
<p>Commissions can be paid either 100% upfront or split 50% upfront and 50% after sketch approval.</p>
<p>Don't send me any payment before I have agreed to give you a slot and requested you to send me the payment.</p>

<h2 class="h2-heading">3. PROCESS AND DELIVERY</h2>
<p>I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a refund (see point 7 further below for more info on refunds)</p>
<p>While I'm working on your commission I will make reviews with you to make sure I make it just right for you!</p>
<p>The amount of reviews depends on the complexity of the work.</p>
<p>During the reviews, you will see work-in-progress and these images will usually include a watermark and be smaller than the finished piece.</p>
<p>The time it takes to finish your commission varies 1 week - 1 months depending on factors such as health, the complexity of the commissioned piece, other work and con seasons.</p>
<p>If anything comes up that will slow the progress of the initially estimated delivery time I will let you know asap.</p>

<h2 class="h2-heading">4. REVISIONS</h2>
<p>You get 3 rounds of changes on the commissioned piece included in the price.</p>
<p>A fee will be added if you want something changed on the final drawing - unless a misunderstanding from my side has been made.</p>
<p>If you wish for me to change something in the drawing you have previously approved, I will charge you a fee to change it. The amount of the extra charge depends on the change you want me to make and is usually based on an hourly wage.</p>
<p>If your reference is unclear to start with changes will come at an extra charge.</p>

<h2 class="h2-heading">5. COPYRIGHT / USAGE POLICY</h2>
<p>I, Anmol Dubey (the artist), claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Promote myself with it everywhere</li>
<li>Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)</li>
<li>Display it everywhere to my liking (website, social media, etc.)</li>
<li>Post it wherever I want</li>
</ol>

<p>The buyer is allowed to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)</li>
<li>Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.</li>
<li>Use the artwork on their Youtube channel and in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following is considered copyright infringement:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially - means making money off it in any way.</li>
<li>Claiming the artwork as your own</li>
<li>Removing my signature from the artwork</li>
<li>Altering the artwork without my consent</li>
</ol>

<p>I reserve the full rights to the Art copy and it's use/distribution unless otherwise agreed upon (rights to the image for your own non-personal use may be purchased at any time).</p>

<h2 class="h2-heading">6. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</h2>
<p>I will do everything I can to make my customers happy!</p>
<p>If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.</p>
<p>I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. If you, e.g., do not want me to post your art anywhere, we can discuss this.</p>

<h2 class="h2-heading">7. REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
<p>The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.</p>
<p>If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.</p>
<p>If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund. If I already started working on it, however, I have the right to keep the percentage of the payment that equals the amount of work I have put into the piece.</p>
